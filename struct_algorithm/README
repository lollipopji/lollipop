This is my first time to use github.
(1)create a new user in the github--create a new repository
(2)copy the https://... then git clone https://...
(3)After you change the files ,use git add * to add to the buffer.
(4)Then you should git commit -a -m "hello". to submit the change.
(5)After that you should push the changes to the web. git push origin master.
(6)Now you can enjoy it!Have fun.
